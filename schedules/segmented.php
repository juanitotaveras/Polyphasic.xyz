      <h1>Segmented Sleep</h1>
  <p>
  Segmented sleep, also known as <i>bimodal</i>, <i>bifurcated</i>, <i>divided</i>, or <i>interrupted sleep</i>, is a sleep pattern where at least two periods of sleep are separated by a period of wakefulness. Before the Industrial Revolution, it was the most common form of sleep in humans of Western Civilization.

<h2> History </h2>

  In his book

  , historian Rovert Ekrich unearths more than 500 references to a segmented sleeping pattern using 20 years of research: from diaries, court records, medical books and literature, Homer's Odyssey to an anthropological account of modern tribes in Nigeria. <!-- Hegarty, Stephanie (22 February 2012). "The myth of the eight-hour sleep". BBC News. -->  </p>
<p> "It's not just the number of references - it is the way they refer to it, as if it was common knowledge," says Ekrich.</p>
<div class='well well-sm'>
<p>Sleep psychologist Gregg Jacobs says that for most of evoltion, we slept in more than one segment. "Waking up during the night is part of normal human physiology."<br>
</div>
Jacobs suggests that this waking period between sleep promoted rest and relaxation, and it could play an important part in the human capacity to naturally regulate stress. <!-- BBC --> <br>
Additionally, during this period the brain releases high levels of prolactin, a hormone associated with a feeling of calm and well-being.</p> 
<p>Oxford professor of neuroscience Russel Foster says that, "Many people wake up at night and panic. I tell them that what they are experiencing is a throwback to the bi-modal sleep pattern"

<h2>Research</h2>
</div>
<h3>Husband Study</h3>
<div class='sect'>
<p> The first documented attempt to compare one continuous block of sleep (monophasic) versus several short sleeps (polyphasic) was that of Husband (1935)<!-- Husband RW (1935): The comparative value of continuous versus interrupted sleep. <i>J Exp Psychol 18:792-796 -->.
Husband hypothesized, "one might sleep two to three hours, stay awake for a number of hours, and then sleep two or three hours more. The prodedure would, in theory, take advantage of two stretches of deep slumber." 
Husband's subject followed a monophasic schedule for one month, sleeping an interrupted 8 hour block of sleep every night. 
He then began a segmented sleep schedule, in which he slept 3 hours, woke up for three hours, and slept a second three-hour core. 
<br><br>
Various performance, physical, and psychological tests showed no signs of deterioration during or after this one-month experimental period. From these results, Husband concluded that "there are no consistent differences between interrupted and continuous sleep; [however] it is recognized that the use of only one subject makes the results only suggestive" (1935, p. 796)

<p>
Psychiatrist Thomas Wehr conducted an experiment in the early 1990s in which a group of people was placed in an isolated building where they had total darkness for 14 hours every day for one month.
</p>
<p> By the fourth week of the experiment, the subjects settled into a very distinct sleeping pattern. They slept first for four hours, woke up for one or two hours, then returned to sleep for four more hours.</p>
